# Captive Network Portal Behavior

> Documentation of captive network portal behavior on different devices

## Background

Public Wi-Fi networks offering temporary internet access often begin new connections using a Captive Portal Mini-Browser (or "CPMB"). These CPMB utilities are built into operating systems in order to make it easier to connect to public Wi-Fi networks. The problem is that their behavior is nuanced, often undocumented and can be difficult to understand. 

The goal for this project is to document captive portal behavior across the various client devices and to hopefully *make it easier to build captive portal solutions that offer a better experience for users*.
