# Captive Network Portal Behavior

> Documentation of captive network portal behavior on different devices

## Background

Public Wi-Fi networks offering short-term or temporary internet access commonly begin new connections using a Captive Portal Mini-Browser. This also happens in fixed and cellular networks in the case of insufficient balance for prepaid tariff plans. Each platform has a native version that is "baked" into the OS. There are also commercial browsers, like Firefox and Chrome that have this built-in support to detect and navigate to the Captive Portal. This mode uses a web-view pushed to the client and has limited capabilities for branding, advertising and other monetization tactics along with limited capabilities with special authorization processes and paid access.

The aim for this project is to define existing use cases for client devices and client manufacturers.
